  abstract   = {MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efﬁcient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common ﬁle formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM’s powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X. It is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com.},

  abstract   = {The Automated force ﬁeld Topology Builder (ATB, http://compbio.biosci.uq.edu.au/atb) is a Web-accessible server that can provide topologies and parameters for a wide range of molecules appropriate for use in molecular simulations, computational drug design, and X-ray reﬁnement. The ATB has three primary functions: (1) to act as a repository for molecules that have been parametrized as part of the GROMOS family of force ﬁelds, (2) to act as a repository for pre-equilibrated systems for use as starting conﬁgurations in molecular dynamics simulations (solvent mixtures, lipid systems pre-equilibrated to adopt a speciﬁc phase, etc.), and (3) to generate force ﬁeld descriptions of novel molecules compatible with the GROMOS family of force ﬁelds in a variety of formats (GROMOS, GROMACS, and CNS). Force ﬁeld descriptions of novel molecules are derived using a multistep process in which results from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are combined with a knowledge-based approach to ensure compatibility (as far as possible) with a speciﬁc parameter set of the GROMOS force ﬁeld. The ATB has several unique features: (1) It requires that the user stipulate the protonation and tautomeric states of the molecule. (2) The symmetry of the molecule is analyzed to ensure that equivalent atoms are assigned identical parameters. (3) Charge groups are assigned automatically. (4) Where the assignment of a given parameter is ambiguous, a range of possible alternatives is provided. The ATB also provides several validation tools to assist the user to assess the degree to which the topology generated may be appropriate for a given task. In addition to detailing the steps involved in generating a force ﬁeld topology compatible with a speciﬁc GROMOS parameter set (GROMOS 53A6), the challenges involved in the automatic generation of force ﬁeld parameters for atomic simulations in general are discussed.},

  abstract = {We apply a new restrained electrostatic potential fit charge model (two-stage RESP) to conformational analysis and the calculation of intermolecular interactions. Specifically, we study conformational energies in butane, methyl ethyl thioether, three simple alcohols, three simple amines, and 1,2-ethanediol as a function of charge model (two-stage RESP vs standard ESP) and 1-4 electrostatic scale factor. We demonstrate that the two-stage RESP model with a 1-4 electrostatic scale factor of —1/1.2 is a very good model, as evaluated by comparison with high-level ab initio calculations. For methanol and /V-methylacetamide interactions with TIP3P water, the two-stage RESP model leads to hydrogen bonds only slightly weaker than found with the standard ESP changes. In tests on DNA base pairs, the two-stage RESP model leads to hydrogen bonds which are {\textasciitilde} 1 kcal/mol weaker than those calculated with the standard ESP charges but closer in magnitude to the best current available ab initio calculations. Furthermore, the two-stage RESP charges, unlike the standard ESP charges, reproduce the result that Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding is stronger than Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding for adenine-thymine base pairs. The free energies of solvation of both methanol and f/ww-iV-methylacetamide were also calculated for the standard ESP and two-stage RESP models and both were in good agreement with experiment. We have combined the use of two-stage RESP charges with multiple conformational fitting—recently employed using standard ESP charges as described by Reynolds, et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 9075)—in studies of conformationally dependent dipole moments and energies of propylamine. We find that the combination of these approaches is synergistic in leading to useful charge distributions for molecular simulations. Two-stage RESP charges thus reproduce both intermolecular and intramolecular energies and structures quite well, making this charge model a critical advancement in the development of a general force field for modeling biological macromolecules and their ligands, both in the gas phase and in solution.},

  abstract   = {The AM1-BCC method quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for use in condensed-phase simulations. The underlying features of the electron distribution including formal charge and delocalization are first captured by AM1 atomic charges for the individual molecule. Bond charge corrections (BCCs), which have been parameterized against the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a training set of compounds containing relevant functional groups, are then added using a formalism identical to the consensus BCI (bond charge increment) approach. As a proof of the concept, we fit BCCs simultaneously to 45 compounds including O-, N-, and S-containing functionalities, aromatics, and heteroaromatics, using only 41 BCC parameters. AM1-BCC yields charge sets of comparable quality to HF/6-31G* ESP-derived charges in a fraction of the time while reducing instabilities in the atomic charges compared to direct ESP-fit methods. We then apply the BCC parameters to a small “test set” consisting of aspirin, d-glucose, and eryodictyol; the AM1-BCC model again provides atomic charges of quality comparable with HF/6-31G* RESP charges, as judged by an increase of only 0.01 to 0.02 atomic units in the root-mean-square (RMS) error in ESP. Based on these encouraging results, we intend to parameterize the AM1-BCC model to provide a consistent charge model for any organic or biological molecule. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract  = {Absolute free energies of hydration have been computed for 13 diverse organic molecules using partial charges derived from ab initio 6-31G* wave functions. Both Mulliken charges and charges fit to the electrostatic potential surface (EPS) were considered in conjunction with OPLS Lennard–Jones parameters for the organic molecules and the TIP4P model of water. Monte Carlo simulations with statistical perturbation theory yielded relative free energies of hydration. These were converted to absolute quantities through perturbations to reference molecules for which absolute free energies of hydration had been obtained previously in TIP4P water. The average errors in the computed absolute free energies of hydration are 1.1 kcal/mol for the 6-31G* EPS charges and 4.0 kcal/mol for the Mulliken charges. For the EPS charges, the largest individual errors are under 2 kcal/mol except for acetamide, in which case the error is 3.7 kcal/mol. The hydrogen bonding between the organic solutes and water has also been characterized. © John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract   = {In molecular simulations with fixed-charge force fields, the choice of partial atomic charges influences numerous computed physical properties, including binding free energies. Many molecular mechanics force fields specify how nonbonded parameters should be determined, but various choices are often available for how these charges are to be determined for arbitrary small molecules. Here, we compute hydration free energies for a set of 44 small, neutral molecules in two different explicit water models (TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew) to examine the influence of charge model on agreement with experiment. Using the AMBER GAFF force field for nonbonded parameters, we test several different methods for obtaining partial atomic charges, including two fast methods exploiting semiempirical quantum calculations and methods deriving charges from the electrostatic potentials computed with several different levels of ab initio quantum calculations with and without a continuum reaction field treatment of solvent. We find that the best charge sets give a root-mean-square error from experiment of roughly 1 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, agreement with experimental hydration free energies does not increase substantially with increasing level of quantum theory, even when the quantum calculations are performed with a reaction field treatment to better model the aqueous phase. We also find that the semiempirical AM1-BCC method for computing charges works almost as well as any of the more computationally expensive ab initio methods and that the root-mean-square error reported here is similar to that for implicit solvent models reported in the literature. Further, we find that the discrepancy with experimental hydration free energies grows substantially with the polarity of the compound, as does its variation across theory levels.},

In the second part of this work, the CHELPG point selection algorithm was used to analyze the changes in the potential-derived charges in formamide during rotation about the CN bond. In order to achieve a level of rotational invariance less than 10\% of the magnitude of the electronic effects studied, an equally-spaced array of points 0.3 Å apart was required. Points found to be greater than 2.8 Å from any nucleus were eliminated, along with all points contained within the defined VDW distances from each of the atoms. The results are compared to those obtained by using CHELP. Even when large numbers of points (ca. 3000) were sampled using the CHELP selection routine, the results did not indicate a satisfactory level of rotatational invariance. On the basis of these results, the original CHELP program was found to be inadequate for analyzing internal rotations.},

  abstract = {The treatment of molecules and crystals by the Heitler-London method or by the collective electron model can be based on the atomic orbitals φμ of the system. These orbitals are in general overlapping, and the corresponding overlap integrals Sμν, given by (1), have almost universally been neglected in the literature as causing undesirable complications. Here we will take these overlap integrals into consideration and show that they, instead of being negligible, are of essential importance in molecules and in crystals. The problem is simply solved by considering the orthonormalized functions [open phi]μ, given by (21), as the real atomic orbitals. The solution is worked out in detail for (I) the molecular orbital method of treating molecules, (II) the Bloch orbital method of treating crystals, and (III) the Heitler-London method of treating both these systems in some simple spin cases. Some numerical applications are given for ionic crystals, showing that the overlap effects are responsible for all the repulsive forces in these solids. It is also shown that the overlapping adds interesting new features to the properties of molecules and crystals, namely the ``many-orbital-effects,'' corresponding to certain ``many-body-forces'' in ionic solids.},

  abstract = {For quantitative description of a molecular charge distribution it is convenient to dissect the molecule into well-defined atomic fragments. A general and natural choice is to share the charge density at each point among the several atoms in proportion to their free-atom densities at the corresponding distances from the nuclei. This prescription yields well-localized bonded-atom distributions each of which closely resembles the molecular density in its vicinity. Integration of the atomic deformation densities — bonded minus free atoms — defines net atomic charges and multipole moments which concisely summarize the molecular charge reorganization. They permit calculation of the external electrostatic potential and of the interaction energy between molecules or between parts of the same molecule. Sample results for several molecules indicate a high transferability of net atomic charges and moments.},
