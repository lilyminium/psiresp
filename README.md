PsiRESP is a package for calculating atomic partial charges from
restrained and unrestrained electrostatic potential fits using Psi4.
It is highly flexible, configurable, easy to use, and totally written in Python.
It supports fitting to multiple orientations and conformers,
as well as both intra-molecular and inter-molecular charge constraints for
multi-molecule fits.
It is written to correspond closely with existing tools such as the
[RESP ESP charge Derive (R.E.D.)](https://upjv.q4md-forcefieldtools.org/RED/) tools.

As of now, the following implementations are well-tested:

* standard 2-stage RESP (convenience class: psiresp.Multi/RespA1)
* standard 1-stage RESP (convenience class: psiresp.Multi/RespA2)
* standard unrestrained ESP (convenience class: psiresp.Multi/EspA1)

These implementations are not as well-tested:
* ESP using HF/STO-3G (convenience class: psiresp.Multi/EspA2) -- Psi4 seems to minimize to a relatively different geometry than GAMESS with STO-3G.
* ATBResp, mimicking the method used by the [Automated Topology Builder](https://atb.uq.edu.au/) is not tested at all. The published methods do not indicate the point density, moreover, the results generated seem to have changed since the original paper. **Use at your own risk.**


### Installation

Create a new conda environment with dependencies. In general, installing the dependencies required will be difficult without `conda`, as both Psi4 and RDKit are most easily distributed through conda.

```
conda env create -f devtools/conda-envs/resp_env.yaml
conda activate psiresp
```

The package is on Pypi, so you can install with `pip`.

```
pip install psiresp
```

To build from source, clone this repository and install the package.

```
git clone https://github.com/lilyminium/psiresp.git
cd psiresp
python setup.py
```


### Example

For example, running a standard 2-stage restrained electrostatic potential fit (Bayly et al., 1993) as standard in AMBER 
(implemented as RESP-A1 in R.E.D.):

```python
   import psi4
   import psiresp

   mol = psi4.Molecule.from_string("""\
      10
      ! from R.E.D. examples/2-Dimethylsulfoxide
      C  3.87500   0.67800  -8.41700
      H  3.80000   1.69000  -8.07600
      H  3.40600   0.02600  -7.71100
      H  3.38900   0.58300  -9.36600
      S  5.35900   0.29300  -8.55900
      O  5.46000  -1.05900  -9.01400
      C  6.05500   0.43000  -7.19300
      H  7.08700   0.16300  -7.29000
      H  5.98000   1.44100  -6.85300
      H  5.58200  -0.21900  -6.48500""", fix_com=True,
      fix_orientation=True)

   r = psiresp.Resp(mol,
                    charge=0,  # overall charge of the molecule
                    multiplicity=1,  # overall multiplicity
                    name="dmso",  # name -- affects directory paths
                    stage_2=True,  # run 2-stage RESP
                    restraint=True,  # restrain ESP fit
                    hyp_a1=0.0005,  # hyperbola restraints for stage 1
                    hyp_a2=0.001,  # hyperbola restraints for stage 2
                    qm_method="hf",
                    qm_basis_set="6-31g*",
                    charge_constraint_options=dict(
                       charge_equivalences=[
                          # constrain first (atom 1) and second (atom 7) carbons to same charge
                          (1, 7),
                          # constrain all Hs to the same charge
                          (2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10),
                          ],
                       charge_constraints=[
                          # constrain the S (atom 5) and O (atom 6) charges to sum to -0.19617
                          (-0.19617, [5, 6]),
                          ],
                       ),
                    # generate 2 orientations per conformer
                    conformer_options=dict(n_reorientations=2),
                    )
   charges = r.run()

```
Alternatively, use the preconfigured RespA1 class in ``psiresp.configs``.

```python

   r = psiresp.RespA1(mol, charge=0, multiplicity=1, name="dmso")
   r.charge_constraint_options.add_charge_equivalence(atom_ids=[1, 7])
   r.charge_constraint_options.add_charge_equivalence(atom_ids=[2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10])
   r.charge_constraint_options.add_charge_constraint(charge=-0.19617, atom_ids=[5, 6])
   r.conformer_options.n_reorientations = 2

   charges = r.run()
```
