Contributing
============

Contributions can take many forms, such as:

    * sharing bug reports or feature requests through the `Issue Tracker`_
    * asking or answering questions, or otherwise joining in on `Discussions`_
    * adding bug fixes, new features, or otherwise improving the code
    * adding or improving documentation

The second two options both involve making a `pull request`_ .

There are many existing guides on how to make a contribution to an open
source project on GitHub, such as the `MDAnalysis User Guide`_ .
In short, the steps are to:

    #. Fork the repository into your own account and download your fork
    #. Create a development environment from source, following the :ref:`Installation` instructions
    #. Create a new branch off the `master` branch with a meaningful name (e.g. ``git checkout -b fix-issue-39``)
    #. Add your modifications to the code or documentation
    #. Add tests if modifying the code
    #. Commit and push changes to GitHub, and open a pull request
