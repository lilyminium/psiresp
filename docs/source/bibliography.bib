	abstract = {The Automated force ﬁeld Topology Builder (ATB, http://compbio.biosci.uq.edu.au/atb) is a Web-accessible server that can provide topologies and parameters for a wide range of molecules appropriate for use in molecular simulations, computational drug design, and X-ray reﬁnement. The ATB has three primary functions: (1) to act as a repository for molecules that have been parametrized as part of the GROMOS family of force ﬁelds, (2) to act as a repository for pre-equilibrated systems for use as starting conﬁgurations in molecular dynamics simulations (solvent mixtures, lipid systems pre-equilibrated to adopt a speciﬁc phase, etc.), and (3) to generate force ﬁeld descriptions of novel molecules compatible with the GROMOS family of force ﬁelds in a variety of formats (GROMOS, GROMACS, and CNS). Force ﬁeld descriptions of novel molecules are derived using a multistep process in which results from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are combined with a knowledge-based approach to ensure compatibility (as far as possible) with a speciﬁc parameter set of the GROMOS force ﬁeld. The ATB has several unique features: (1) It requires that the user stipulate the protonation and tautomeric states of the molecule. (2) The symmetry of the molecule is analyzed to ensure that equivalent atoms are assigned identical parameters. (3) Charge groups are assigned automatically. (4) Where the assignment of a given parameter is ambiguous, a range of possible alternatives is provided. The ATB also provides several validation tools to assist the user to assess the degree to which the topology generated may be appropriate for a given task. In addition to detailing the steps involved in generating a force ﬁeld topology compatible with a speciﬁc GROMOS parameter set (GROMOS 53A6), the challenges involved in the automatic generation of force ﬁeld parameters for atomic simulations in general are discussed.},

	abstract = {We apply a new restrained electrostatic potential fit charge model (two-stage RESP) to conformational analysis and the calculation of intermolecular interactions. Specifically, we study conformational energies in butane, methyl ethyl thioether, three simple alcohols, three simple amines, and 1,2-ethanediol as a function of charge model (two-stage RESP vs standard ESP) and 1-4 electrostatic scale factor. We demonstrate that the two-stage RESP model with a 1-4 electrostatic scale factor of —1/1.2 is a very good model, as evaluated by comparison with high-level ab initio calculations. For methanol and /V-methylacetamide interactions with TIP3P water, the two-stage RESP model leads to hydrogen bonds only slightly weaker than found with the standard ESP changes. In tests on DNA base pairs, the two-stage RESP model leads to hydrogen bonds which are {\textasciitilde} 1 kcal/mol weaker than those calculated with the standard ESP charges but closer in magnitude to the best current available ab initio calculations. Furthermore, the two-stage RESP charges, unlike the standard ESP charges, reproduce the result that Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding is stronger than Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding for adenine-thymine base pairs. The free energies of solvation of both methanol and f/ww-iV-methylacetamide were also calculated for the standard ESP and two-stage RESP models and both were in good agreement with experiment. We have combined the use of two-stage RESP charges with multiple conformational fitting—recently employed using standard ESP charges as described by Reynolds, et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 9075)—in studies of conformationally dependent dipole moments and energies of propylamine. We find that the combination of these approaches is synergistic in leading to useful charge distributions for molecular simulations. Two-stage RESP charges thus reproduce both intermolecular and intramolecular energies and structures quite well, making this charge model a critical advancement in the development of a general force field for modeling biological macromolecules and their ligands, both in the gas phase and in solution.},
